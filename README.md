Brief for Reddit

Reddit client for Samsung Galaxy watch.

It's very barebones and currently only supports one post type.
I currently don't have time to develop this app further, so I'll leave this code here.

It uses some sketchy Xamarin libraries that aren't being developed anymore, thus it has some bugs.
